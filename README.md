# neural_network_voice_recognition_demo
This program lets a user to create his own neural network with records of words ors sentenses 
(1,5 sec record) and check how it works -> record and predict.

It's comfortable to run this code with jupyter notebook (files are saved in jupyter notebook file)
and run each cell few times (to create many records and after all learn a neural network).
